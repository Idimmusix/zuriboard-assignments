# zuriboard-assignments
This is a series of assignments (or tasks),
that I did in 2022 while learning fullstack dev (python-backend html-css-js frontend) with zuriboard/14IG
=======
In one of my previous assignments, I was marked down, the mentor that graded said my files were not found.

So I want to update the only remaining assignments of mine in tgis repository that is not marked to "main".
